					<p class = "content">Crossfit is as hard or as easy as you make it. The workouts can be adjusted to each individual's current workout level (scaling). Scaling is actually encouraged in Crossfit
                        and is preferred over people hurting themselves. If you are tired or sore and can't do the weight you normally do, that is okay. Everybody has those days and it's better to lower the weight 
                    than risk injury. </p>

					<p class = "content">I love Crossfit because every day is a new challenge. I can identify movement patterns in Crossfit that I perform in everyday life and I use what I learn in Crossfit to perform those movements in a safer manner.
                        I also really like that men and women do the same workouts; there isn't a separate workout just for men or just for women. The only difference between the men and the women is the weight that they use during the workout. Crossfit has made me 
                    stronger, more confident and taught me that my mind will give up a lot sooner than my body will. I would encourage everyone to try Crossfit. It is empowering to we what you are truly capable of. </p>
